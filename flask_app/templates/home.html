              individual stock performance. It then generates an optimized

              investment across different stocks, reducing the risk of loss.
              <br />2) Maximizing Returns: It identifies the optimal combination
              of stocks that have the potential to generate higher returns.
              <br />3) Risk Management: It helps in managing risk by considering
              factors such as volatility, correlation, and historical
              performance. <br />4) Time-saving: It automates the process of
              portfolio optimization, saving time and effort for investors.
